// Card game "War" Setup:

// 1. Create the basic structures:
//    - Create a Card class: Each card has a suit and rank.
//    - Create a Deck class: The deck contains 52 cards, shuffled randomly.
//    - Create a Player class: Each player has a name and a hand of cards.


// 2. Shuffling and Dealing:
//    - In the Deck class, implement methods to shuffle the cards and deal cards to players.


// 3. Game Logic:
//    - In the Player class, implement methods to draw a card from their hand and compare cards with another player.
//    - In the main game loop, players take turns drawing cards, comparing ranks, and resolving "war" scenarios.


// 4. Winning:
//    - Keep track of the number of cards each player has. The player with all the cards wins.


// 5. User Interaction:
//    - Display game prompts to the user for each round.
//    - Show the cards played by both players and the outcome of each round.
//    - Display the winner at the end of the game.


// 6. Error Handling:
//    - Handle cases where players run out of cards, especially during "war" scenarios.
