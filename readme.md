Card game "War" Setup:

Create a Card class: Each card has a suit and rank. Create a Deck class: The deck contains 52 cards, shuffled randomly. Create a Player class: Each player has a name and a hand of cards. Shuffling and Dealing:

In the Deck class, implement methods to shuffle the cards and deal cards to players. Game Logic:

In the Player class, implement methods to draw a card from their hand and compare cards with another player. In the main game loop, players take turns drawing cards, comparing ranks, and resolving "war" scenarios. Winning:

Keep track of the number of cards each player has. The player with all the cards wins. User Interaction:

Display game prompts to the user for each round. Show the cards played by both players and the outcome of each round. Display the winner at the end of the game. Error Handling:

Handle cases where players run out of cards, especially during "war" scenarios.
